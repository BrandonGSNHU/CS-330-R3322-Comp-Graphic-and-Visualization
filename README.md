How do I approach Designing software?
  - As I take on more projects the importance of laying out a plan for my designs becomes increasingly more important. Taking the time and writing psuedocode as well as planning out what I want to accomplish each day helps tremendously to see something through correctly the first time. These are skills that can be used in any form of coding and will definitely be utilized in my future over and over again.

How do I appoach developing programs?
  - With every project I take on I gain a little more experience and I try to absorb as much information as possible. This was my first experience with openGL in any form so there was a lot to commit to memory. One of the most important skills I was able to hone throughout this course is easily my debugging and troubleshooting. Being able to master is something that will carry me far into my career with coding and computers. This course also helped hammer in writing a few lines of code and then running to ensure everything is working properly before getting to far into the project.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  - Computer science will help me develop my programming skills in general but also across multiple languages. This will help broaden my experience and get me comfortable with most of the popular languages. My ultimate goal with this is getting into video game development so any experience I gain here will be carried on throughout the rest of my professional career.
